Are there unit tests for the API?

Ensure that you have written unit tests for all API endpoints to verify that they work correctly.
Are there unit tests for the model?

Confirm that there are unit tests for functions and classes related to your model, testing the accuracy and performance of the model.
Are there unit tests for the logging?

Check if you have unit tests to ensure that logging functions work correctly and capture necessary information.
Can all of the unit tests be run with a single script and do all of the unit tests pass?

Create a script to run all unit tests and ensure that they all pass when executed together.
Is there a mechanism to monitor performance?

Implement performance monitoring for your model and API, possibly using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or other integrated monitoring solutions.
Was there an attempt to isolate the read/write unit tests from production models and logs?

Ensure that you have separated unit tests related to reading/writing to avoid affecting production models and logs.
Does the API work as expected? For example, can you get predictions for a specific country as well as for all countries combined?

Check that the API can return predictions for specific countries and a combined total for all countries.
Does the data ingestion exist as a function or script to facilitate automation?

Ensure that the data ingestion process is encapsulated in a function or script that can run automatically.
Were multiple models compared?

Perform comparisons of the performance between multiple models to identify the best model for the task.
Did the EDA investigation use visualizations?

In the exploratory data analysis (EDA), use charts and graphics to present important relationships and characteristics in the data.
Is everything containerized within a working Docker image?

Confirm that all components of the application are containerized and can run in a Docker image.
Did they use a visualization to compare their model to the baseline model?

Use visualizations to compare the performance of the current model with the baseline model to illustrate improvements.
